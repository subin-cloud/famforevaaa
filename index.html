      Well, hi it's me again, the narrator
Here we have the 02/02/2024 rememberance and looking up to my gallery, on finding something real beautiful. There's the octagonal army, filled with some donkeys and smarties and beauties. And on seeing the first video, you can see sanal uncle literally smiling.
It was so well coordinated and with the support of them as well, sanal uncle didn't want to come in frame after I asked, and there comes a donkey neha, with the words of not being in frame and amanda thinking of something else when fanny kept it as a heart.
And the subin yapping, and all in such a pleasant, beautiful mood before the boards ahahahah and ye rest of 4, but nandana with a crown boguht by amanda for 300 fils (I guess, cz I pretty much looted her that day)and ye restjust smiling and me with an uncle aaah post with no beard just a jaw and hair or anything, but overall worth it performance and a worth it day and a worth it night with them.
The reunion or smthg like the part of 2022 christmas at same venue fyi, but all changed by minds and looks but not by soul or heart and yeah it's just me w the whole crew, missing my dearest loves ong. Hehehegeeheh, and there I'll come back again.
*quality might be weird as it was taken my motorola, and therefore quality doesn't matter when memories are created.
